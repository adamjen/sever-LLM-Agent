# Task: Create Initial Idea Document for Agent's Feature

This task involves creating a new document outlining an initial idea for an agent feature. The document should be structured similarly to `docs/finding.md`.

## Subtasks

### 1. Create the new document file

- Create a new file named `agent-feature-idea.md` inside the `docs/` directory.

### 2. Draft the content for the idea document

- The content should follow the structure of `docs/finding.md`.
- The proposed feature is a "Code-Generating Agent" that writes SIRS code from a high-level description.

#### Document Structure:

1.  **Title:**
    ```markdown
    # Initial Idea: Code-Generating Agent Feature
    ```

2.  **Introduction:**
    - Briefly introduce the concept of an agent that can understand high-level descriptions and generate SIRS code.

3.  **Section 1: High-Level Goal Specification**
    - Explain how a user would provide input to the agent.
    - Example of a user's natural language request.

4.  **Section 2: Agent's Internal Model (Beliefs)**
    - Describe how the agent would represent the user's request internally using a probabilistic model.
    - Use concepts from SIRS like `graphical_node`, `latent`, `observed`, etc. to model the problem space.
    - Provide a conceptual SIRS model snippet.

5.  **Section 3: Code Generation (Decision & Action)**
    - Explain the process of generating SIRS code from the agent's internal model.
    - This is the "decision-making" part of the agent.
    - Show an example of the generated SIRS code.

6.  **Section 4: Conceptual Workflow Loop**
    - Outline the step-by-step loop for the agent's operation:
        1.  **Perceive:** Get user's high-level request.
        2.  **Model/Infer:** Update internal beliefs based on the request.
        3.  **Decide/Act:** Generate the SIRS code.
        4.  **Refine:** (Optional) Get feedback and refine the code.
        5.  **Repeat.**

### 3. Review and Finalize

- Review the created `docs/agent-feature-idea.md` for clarity, consistency with `docs/finding.md`, and completeness.
- Ensure all sections are well-defined and the examples are illustrative.
- [x] Create an initial idea document for the agent's feature at `docs/agent-feature-idea.md`.
- [ ] Create a High-Level Design (HLD) document for the agent's feature at `docs/agent-feature-hld.md`.
