# Integration Specification for LLM Agent System

**Objective:** Ensure full compliance with the technical architecture and integration requirements defined in `memory-bank/technicalArchitecture.md` while implementing the specification from `examples/sirs-spec.json`.

## Checklist Items

1. **Component Mapping Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm all components in `memory-bank/technicalArchitecture.md` are correctly mapped to implementation files
   - [ ] Validate component interfaces match architectural definitions
   - [ ] Ensure each component has appropriate dependency relationships

2. **Function Definition Compliance**
   - [ ] Verify all core functions (e.g., `sirs_converter.zig`, `sev_generator.zig`) adhere to specification requirements
   - [ ] Confirm function parameters and return types align with spec

3. **Type System Validation**
   - [ ] Confirm all type definitions in `src/sev.zig` match the architecture document
   - [ ] Verify DebugInfo struct in `debugger.zig` implements full source mapping capabilities
   
   - [ ] Ensure DebugSymbol tracking in `debugger.zig` aligns with SIRS program semantics
   
   - [ ] Validate JSON formatting rules in `formatter.zig` against sirs-spec.json requirements
   
   - [ ] Confirm variable assignment hooks in `debugger.zig` capture all state changes
   
   - [ ] Verify call stack management in `debugger.zig` handles nested function calls correctly
   
   - [ ] Ensure typeToString implementation in `debug_info_generator.zig` covers all SIRS data types
   - [ ] Validate type system compliance with `examples/sirs-spec.json`

4. **Dependency Management**
   - [ ] Verify all external dependencies are properly declared and managed
   - [ ] Confirm internal component dependencies follow architectural guidelines

5. **Code Generation Validation**
   - [ ] Ensure code generation logic in `src/codegen.zig` matches spec requirements
   - [ ] Validate generated code conforms to architecture patterns

6. **Error Handling Implementation**
   - [ ] Implement error handling according to specification requirements
   - [ ] Verify all components have proper error propagation mechanisms

7. **Test Coverage Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm test coverage for all critical integration paths
   - [ ] Ensure test cases in `examples/assignment_test.sirs.json` match spec requirements

8. **Performance Requirements**
   - [ ] Validate performance characteristics meet specification benchmarks
   - [ ] Verify optimization strategies are implemented where required

9. **Documentation Alignment**
   - [ ] Ensure documentation in `LLM-Agent/docs` matches architectural and spec definitions
   - [ ] Confirm all public interfaces have appropriate documentation

10. **Compliance Reporting**
    - [ ] Generate integration compliance report using `src/reporter.zig`
    - [ ] Validate report output against specification requirements
