# Agentic Workflow in SIRS Language: Conceptual Findings

This document outlines a conceptual framework for creating an agentic workflow using the SIRS language, based on its capabilities for probabilistic inference and graphical models.

## 1. Define Your Agent's Beliefs and Environment (Probabilistic Model)

An agent's understanding of its environment and internal state can be modeled using SIRS's probabilistic constructs:

*   **Graphical Nodes (`graphical_node`):**
    *   `observed`: For data the agent perceives from the environment (e.g., sensor readings).
    *   `latent`: For hidden states or unobservable variables the agent needs to infer (e.g., true room temperature, user intent).
    *   `parameter`, `hyperparameter`: For parameters of distributions within the model, which can also be inferred or learned.
    *   `deterministic`: For variables whose values are directly computed from other variables in the model.
*   **Plates (`plate`):** Used to represent repeated structures in the model, enabling efficient representation of collections of similar entities or observations (e.g., multiple agents, time series data).
*   **Factors (`factor`):** Define the probabilistic relationships and dependencies between variables. These can represent:
    *   `likelihood`: How observed data is generated given latent variables or parameters.
    *   `prior`: Initial beliefs about latent variables or parameters before observing data.
    *   `constraint`, `soft_constraint`: Imposing restrictions or preferences on variable values.

**Conceptual Model Definition Example:**

```sirs
model AgentBeliefs {
    // Observed node: what the agent sees
    graphical_node temperature: normal(mu, sigma) observed_value: current_temp;

    // Latent node: what the agent infers
    graphical_node room_state: categorical(state_probs) latent;

    // Parameter node: inferred parameter for the temperature distribution
    graphical_node mu: normal(0, 10) parameter;
    graphical_node sigma: exponential(1) parameter;

    // Factor: defines the relationship between room_state and temperature parameters
    factor temp_likelihood(temperature, room_state, mu, sigma) = {
        if (room_state == "cold") {
            temperature ~ normal(mu_cold, sigma_cold);
        } else if (room_state == "warm") {
            temperature ~ normal(mu_warm, sigma_warm);
        }
    } likelihood;
}
```

## 2. Perceive and Update Beliefs (Observation and Inference)

The agent continuously updates its internal model based on new information:

*   **Observation (`observe`):** This statement allows the agent to incorporate new data into its probabilistic model, effectively conditioning the model on observed values.
*   **Inference (`infer`):** This expression is central to the agent's learning process. It takes a defined model and observed data, and returns samples or estimates of the latent variables and parameters. This is where SIRS's MCMC engine would be leveraged to perform the probabilistic computations.

**Conceptual Observation and Inference Example:**

```sirs
// Agent observes the current temperature
observe temperature: normal(mu, sigma) value: 22.5;

// Agent infers the room state and updated parameters based on the observation
let inferred_state = infer AgentBeliefs with data {
    temperature: 22.5
};

// inferred_state would contain samples for room_state, mu, sigma
```

## 3. Act Based on Inferred Beliefs (Decision Making)

While SIRS primarily focuses on probabilistic modeling and inference, the results of inference can directly inform decision-making logic:

*   **Control Flow (`if`, `match`):** These statements can be used to implement decision logic that reacts to the inferred values. For instance, if the inferred `room_state` is "cold," the agent's logic could trigger an external action.

**Conceptual Decision Making Example:**

```sirs
// After inference, analyze the inferred_state
let most_likely_room_state = get_mode(inferred_state.room_state); // Assuming a helper function

if (most_likely_room_state == "cold") {
    print("Room is likely cold. Consider adjusting heating.");
    // In a real agent, this would trigger an external action, e.g.,
    // call_external_api("turn_on_heater");
} else if (most_likely_room_state == "warm") {
    print("Room is likely warm. All good.");
}
```

## Conceptual Agentic Workflow Loop:

1.  **Perceive:** The agent receives new data from its environment (e.g., sensor readings, user input).
2.  **Model/Infer:** The agent uses its SIRS probabilistic model to update its beliefs about the environment and its own state, performing inference on latent variables and parameters.
3.  **Decide:** Based on the inferred beliefs (e.g., the most likely state, or the posterior distribution of a critical variable), the agent's internal logic determines a course of action.
4.  **Act (External):** The SIRS program outputs a decision or a command that an external system or another part of the agent's architecture can execute. This part typically involves integration with external APIs or systems.
5.  **Repeat:** The cycle continues as new observations become available, allowing the agent to adapt and learn over time.

This framework demonstrates how SIRS can be a powerful tool for building intelligent agents capable of reasoning under uncertainty and making data-driven decisions.
