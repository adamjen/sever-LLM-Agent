To ensure the reliability, robustness, and correctness of the core agent components before further development or deployment. This aligns with the `testing-framework-specification.md`.

## Implementation Details
- Unit tests were created for `agent_core.agent.py`.
- Integration tests were created for `sirs_integration.sirs_engine.py`.
- Functional tests were created for the API (`api/main.py`) and CLI (`cli/cli.py`).
- A `pyproject.toml` was added to configure test paths.
- All tests are passing.
