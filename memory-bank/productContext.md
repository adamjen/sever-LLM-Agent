## Project Goal
The project aims to develop a robust SIRS language compiler with efficient MCMC algorithms.

## Key Features
- Probabilistic inference using MCMC Engine
- Semantic analysis through Dependency Analyzer and AST Query Tool
- Format translation via Code Generator

## Overall Architecture
The system architecture is designed to handle SIRS language compilation, implement MCMC algorithms for probabilistic inference, manage package dependencies, provide access to abstract syntax trees, and translate high-level constructs to target formats.
