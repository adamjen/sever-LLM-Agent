# Testing Framework Specification

This document defines the testing strategies and coverage requirements for the LLM Agent system.

## 1. Unit Test Coverage

This section specifies the unit test coverage targets for each component. Coverage targets are set based on component criticality and complexity; for instance, the FastAPI service has a higher target due to its role as the primary user interface.

- **Agent Core:** 90%
- **SIRS Engine:** 85%
- **FastAPI Service:** 95%

Coverage metrics include both **line coverage** and **branch coverage**.

### 1.1. Mutation Testing

To ensure test suite robustness, mutation testing will be employed. The goal is to achieve a mutation score of at least 80% for all critical components.

## 2. Integration Test Scenarios

This section provides a matrix of integration test scenarios.

| Component A | Component B | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| FastAPI Service | Agent Core | Valid query submitted | Correct response from agent |
| Agent Core | SIRS Engine | Probabilistic model execution | Correct inference results |
| Agent Core | LM Studio | LLM prompt sent | Valid LLM response received |
| FastAPI Service | Agent Core | Invalid query submitted | Appropriate error message |
| Agent Core | SIRS Engine | SIRS Engine timeout | Graceful error handling and timeout message |
| Agent Core | LM Studio | LM Studio unavailable | Service degradation message |
| FastAPI Service | Agent Core | SQL injection attempt | Request rejected |
| FastAPI Service | Agent Core | Malformed JSON input | 400 Bad Request error |
| FastAPI Service | Agent Core | Oversized payload | 413 Payload Too Large error |

## 3. Performance Testing Methodology

This section outlines the methodology for performance testing.

- **Load Testing:** Simulate a high number of concurrent users sending queries to the agent to measure response times and resource utilization.
- **Stress Testing:** Push the system to its limits to identify breaking points and bottlenecks.
- **Soak Testing:** Run the system under a normal load for an extended period to check for memory leaks or other long-term issues.

### 3.1. Performance Benchmarks

- **Max Concurrent Users:** 500
- **Acceptable Latency:** P99 < 500ms
- **Error Rate Threshold:** < 0.1%

### 3.2. Performance Testing Tools

- **Load Testing:** Locust
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana

## 4. LLM Output Validation

This section describes the procedures for validating the output of the Large Language Model.

- **Factual Accuracy:** Cross-reference LLM responses with known facts where possible.
- **Response Relevance:** Ensure the LLM's response is relevant to the user's query.
- **Toxicity and Bias Detection:** Use automated tools and manual review to check for harmful or biased content in the LLM's output.
- **Response Formatting:** Validate that the output adheres to the defined formatting standards.
- **Schema Adherence:** Ensure the output matches any predefined response schemas.

### 4.1. Validation Tools

- **Toxicity/Bias Detection:** Perspective API, Hugging Face's Evaluate library

### 4.2. Process for Handling Invalid Outputs

- **False Positives:** A manual review process will be in place to identify and flag false positives from automated detection tools.
- **Escalation:** Problematic outputs will be escalated to the development team for immediate review and remediation.

## 5. Security Testing

Security testing will be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. The focus will be on the OWASP Top 10, including but not limited to:

- Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)
- Broken authentication and session management
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure deserialization
- Security misconfigurations

## 6. Documentation Testing

All documentation, including this specification, will be reviewed for:

- **Clarity:** Is the documentation easy to understand?
- **Accuracy:** Is the information correct and up-to-date?
- **Completeness:** Are there any gaps in the documentation?

## 7. Test Environment

All tests will be conducted in a dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This includes:

- Identical hardware specifications
- Same operating system and software versions
- Production-like data volumes and network conditions
