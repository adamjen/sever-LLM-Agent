# Security Protocol Handbook

This document outlines the security measures and compliance requirements for the LLM Agent system.

## 1. API Key Management

This section describes the procedures for managing API keys for services like LM Studio.

- **Storage:** API keys must be stored securely, for example, using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager). They should not be hardcoded in the source code.
- **Rotation:** API keys should be rotated periodically.
    - **Frequency:** Quarterly (every 3 months) or as mandated by specific service providers.
    - **Automation:** Automated rotation mechanisms will be implemented where supported by the secrets management service. Manual rotation procedures will be documented for services without automation.
    - **Responsibility:** The DevOps team is responsible for implementing and overseeing automated key rotation. Application teams are responsible for integrating with rotated keys.
- **Access Control (Least Privilege):** Access to API keys must strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only necessary personnel and services will have access, and only to the specific keys they require for their functions. Access will be managed via IAM roles and policies.

## 2. Input Sanitization

This section defines the standards for sanitizing user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

- All user-provided input must be treated as untrusted.
- Implement input validation and sanitization routines to strip or encode malicious characters and scripts.
- Define a list of allowed characters and patterns for user inputs. Concrete examples or references to a specific standard, library, or internal policy document where these are defined will be provided.
- **Security Impacts:** Unsanitized inputs can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, command injection, and other forms of data manipulation or unauthorized access, depending on the system's architecture and how inputs are processed.

## 3. Prompt Injection Countermeasures

This section details the measures to be taken to prevent prompt injection attacks.

- **Instructional Prompts:** Use clear and direct instructions in system-level prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and constrain its responses, making it less susceptible to external manipulation.
- **Input Delimiters:** Use distinct delimiters (e.g., XML tags, specific character sequences) to clearly separate user input from the system prompt instructions, preventing the LLM from misinterpreting user input as part of its core instructions.
- **Privileged Access Separation:** Run the LLM inference environment with minimal system privileges. The LLM agent should operate within a sandboxed environment with restricted network access and file system permissions to limit the impact of successful injection attacks.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** For sensitive or high-risk operations (e.g., financial transactions, data deletion), incorporate human review steps where the LLM's proposed actions or outputs are reviewed and approved by a human before execution.
- **Red Teaming/Adversarial Testing:** Conduct regular red teaming exercises and adversarial testing to proactively identify and mitigate new prompt injection vectors and vulnerabilities. This involves simulating malicious user inputs to test the robustness of the countermeasures.
- **Content Filtering APIs:** Utilize external content moderation or filtering APIs (e.g., from cloud providers or specialized vendors) to pre-process user inputs for malicious content and post-process LLM outputs to ensure they do not contain harmful, biased, or unintended information.
- **Output Filtering Methodology:** Implement robust output filtering mechanisms. This can involve:
    - **Regex and Keyword Blocking:** Using regular expressions and predefined keyword lists to identify and block known malicious patterns or sensitive information in the LLM's output.
    - **Smaller LLM for Moderation:** Employing a smaller, fine-tuned LLM specifically for content moderation and validation of the primary LLM's output.
    - **Semantic Analysis:** Analyzing the semantic meaning of the output to detect and filter out responses that deviate from expected behavior or contain harmful intent.

## 4. Audit Logging

This section specifies what information needs to be logged for security auditing purposes.

- **Log all API requests and responses:** This includes the user, timestamp, query, and response.
- **Log all security-related events:** This includes authentication successes and failures, authorization checks, and any detected security threats.
- **Log Retention:** Audit logs will be retained for a minimum of 1 year for operational and security analysis, and 7 years for compliance and forensic purposes, or as mandated by specific regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Log Integrity and Immutability:** Measures will be implemented to ensure the integrity and immutability of logs, including:
    - **Secure Storage:** Logs will be stored in tamper-resistant storage solutions.
    - **Hashing and Digital Signatures:** Implement hashing and digital signatures to detect any unauthorized modifications to log files.
    - **Restricted Access:** Access to log files will be strictly restricted to authorized personnel and automated systems for analysis.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Continuous monitoring of audit logs will be established to detect suspicious activities, anomalies, and potential security threats. Automated alerting mechanisms will be configured to notify the security team of critical events in real-time.
- **Data Masking/Redaction:** Sensitive information (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), API keys, confidential prompts/responses) will be masked or redacted within logs to comply with privacy regulations and minimize data exposure.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

This section details how users and other services authenticate with the LLM Agent system and the authorization mechanisms in place.

- **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, API tokens) for users and services interacting with the LLM Agent. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be enforced where applicable.
- **Authorization:** Define and enforce fine-grained authorization policies to control access to different functionalities, data, and LLM models based on roles and permissions. The principle of least privilege will be strictly applied.

## 6. Data Privacy & Confidentiality

This section outlines policies and procedures for handling, storing, and protecting sensitive data processed by the LLM Agent.

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data, including prompts, responses, and any intermediate data, will be encrypted at rest (e.g., using AES-256) and in transit (e.g., using TLS 1.2+).
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and process only the minimum amount of sensitive data necessary for the LLM Agent's functionality.
- **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Implement techniques to anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data before it is processed by the LLM, where feasible and appropriate.
- **Data Retention:** Define clear data retention policies for sensitive data, ensuring it is deleted securely after its purpose has been fulfilled.

## 7. Model Security

This section describes measures to ensure the integrity and security of the LLM model itself.

- **Model Tampering Protection:** Implement controls to prevent unauthorized modification or tampering of the LLM model and its associated files. This includes integrity checks and secure storage.
- **Supply Chain Security:** Ensure the security of the LLM model supply chain, from pre-trained models to fine-tuning data and deployment artifacts. Verify the authenticity and integrity of all components.
- **Fine-tuning Data Security:** Securely store and process any data used for fine-tuning the LLM, applying the same data privacy and confidentiality measures as for other sensitive data.

## 8. Vulnerability Management

This section outlines the process for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities.

- **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct automated vulnerability scans of the LLM Agent system, its dependencies, and underlying infrastructure on a regular basis.
- **Penetration Testing:** Perform periodic penetration tests by independent security experts to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Triaging and Remediation:** Establish a clear process for triaging identified vulnerabilities based on severity and impact, and ensure timely remediation.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update third-party libraries and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## 9. Incident Response

This section provides a high-level overview of the incident response plan specifically tailored for security incidents related to the LLM Agent.

- **Detection:** Implement mechanisms for early detection of security incidents, including anomaly detection, log monitoring, and security information and event management (SIEM) integration.
- **Containment:** Define procedures to contain the impact of a security incident, such as isolating affected systems or revoking compromised credentials.
- **Eradication:** Outline steps to remove the root cause of the incident and eliminate any malicious components.
- **Recovery:** Detail procedures for restoring affected systems and data to a secure and operational state.
- **Post-Incident Analysis:** Conduct thorough post-incident reviews to identify lessons learned and implement preventative measures.

## 10. Compliance

This section explicitly lists relevant regulatory compliance standards that the LLM Agent system must adhere to.

- The LLM Agent system will adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations, including but not limited to:
    - **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** For handling personal data of EU citizens.
    - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** If processing protected health information.
    - **SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2):** For security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
    - **ISO 27001:** For establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system.
- Security protocols outlined in this handbook contribute directly to meeting the requirements of these compliance standards.
