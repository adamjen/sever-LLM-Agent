# Performance Benchmark Report

This document establishes baseline performance metrics and optimization targets for the LLM Agent.

## 1. Latency Measurements

This section provides latency measurements for each component of the system.

| Component | Average Latency (ms) | 95th Percentile Latency (ms) |
|---|---|---|
| FastAPI Service | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| Agent Core | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| SIRS Engine | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| LM Studio | *TBD* | *TBD* |

*(TBD: To Be Determined from performance testing results)*

## 2. Resource Utilization Profiles

This section details the CPU and memory utilization profiles for each component.

| Component | Average CPU Utilization (%) | Peak Memory Usage (MB) |
|---|---|---|
| FastAPI Service | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| Agent Core | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| SIRS Engine | *TBD* | *TBD* |

*(TBD: To Be Determined from performance testing results)*

## 3. Load Testing Results

This section presents the results from load testing.

- **Max Concurrent Users:** *TBD*
- **Requests Per Second (RPS) at Peak:** *TBD*
- **Error Rate under Load:** *TBD*

*(TBD: To Be Determined from load testing results)*

## 4. Scaling Recommendations

This section provides recommendations for scaling the system.

*(Recommendations for horizontal and vertical scaling based on the benchmark results will be added here.)*
