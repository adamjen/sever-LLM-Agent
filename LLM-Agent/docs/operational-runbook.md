# Operational Runbook

This document provides procedures for the production deployment and maintenance of the LLM Agent.

## 1. Deployment Checklist

This section contains a checklist of steps to be followed for deploying the agent to production.

- [ ] Ensure all tests have passed.
- [ ] Build the production container images.
- [ ] Push images to the container registry.
- [ ] Update the Kubernetes deployment configuration.
- [ ] Apply the new configuration to the production cluster.
- [ ] Monitor the deployment for any issues.

## 2. Monitoring and Alerting

This section describes the monitoring and alerting configuration.

- **Metrics to Monitor:**
  - API request latency and error rates.
  - CPU and memory utilization of all components.
  - SIRS model inference time.
- **Alerting Thresholds:**
  - High API error rate (> 5%).
  - High CPU utilization (> 80% for 5 minutes).
  - High memory utilization (> 80%).
- **Alerting Channels:**
  - PagerDuty for critical alerts.
  - Slack for warning alerts.

## 3. Log Analysis Procedures

This section provides procedures for analyzing logs.

- Logs are aggregated in a central logging system (e.g., ELK stack).
- Dashboards are set up to visualize key metrics from the logs.
- Procedures for searching and filtering logs to diagnose issues are documented here.

## 4. Disaster Recovery Plan

This section outlines the plan for recovering from a disaster.

- **Backup and Restore:** Regular backups of the configuration and any persistent data are taken. Procedures for restoring from backup are documented here.
- **Failover:** The system is deployed in a high-availability configuration across multiple availability zones. In case of a failure in one zone, traffic is automatically routed to another.
- **Rollback:** If a new deployment causes issues, a procedure for rolling back to the previous stable version is in place.
